# Learn Rust by Doing: An Applied, Hands-On Roadmap

Welcome! This guide is designed to make you proficient in Rust through practical, project-based learning. Each topic includes hands-on exercises and real-world applications.

## Learning Plan

1. **Setting Up Your Rust Development Environment**
   - Install Rust, set up your editor, and run your first program.

2. **Hello, Cargo!**
   - Use Cargo to create, build, and run projects. Explore project structure.

3. **Variables, Data Types, and Mutability**
   - Practice with variables, constants, shadowing, and type inference.

4. **Control Flow in Action**
   - Write programs using `if`, `match`, loops, and pattern matching.

5. **Functions and Modular Code**
   - Build reusable functions and split code into modules.

6. **Ownership, Borrowing, and References**
   - Experiment with Rust's memory safety model through small programs.

7. **Structs and Enums: Modeling Data**
   - Design and use custom data types in practical mini-projects.

8. **Collections and Iterators**
   - Manipulate vectors, strings, hash maps, and use iterators in real tasks.

9. **Error Handling: Result and Option**
   - Handle errors and absence of values in file and user input operations.

10. **File I/O and the Filesystem**
    - Read from and write to files, and explore directories.

11. **Testing Your Code**
    - Write and run unit and integration tests for your projects.

12. **Building a Command-Line Tool**
    - Create a useful CLI application from scratch.

13. **Using External Crates**
    - Add dependencies, use popular crates, and publish your own.

14. **Concurrency: Threads and Channels**
    - Write concurrent programs using threads and message passing.

15. **Networking: HTTP Client/Server**
    - Build a simple web client or server to interact with the internet.

16. **Interacting with JSON and APIs**
    - Parse JSON and call real-world APIs.

17. **Debugging and Profiling**
    - Use Rust's debugging and profiling tools to improve your code.

18. **Capstone Project**
    - Apply everything by building a complete, real-world application.
